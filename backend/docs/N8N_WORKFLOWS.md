# N8N Automation Workflows for FastenMind

This document describes the automated workflows integrated with the FastenMind system using N8N.

## Overview

The FastenMind system integrates with N8N to provide automated workflows for various business processes. These workflows are triggered by system events and can automate tasks such as notifications, data synchronization, and process automation.

## Implemented Workflows

### 1. Cost Update Reminder
**Trigger**: Daily schedule (9:00 AM)
**Purpose**: Remind engineers to update material and process costs
**Actions**:
- Check for materials with outdated costs (>30 days)
- Check for process templates not updated in 60 days
- Send email notifications to responsible engineers
- Create tasks in the system

### 2. Exchange Rate Updates
**Trigger**: Daily schedule (8:00 AM)
**Purpose**: Fetch and update currency exchange rates
**Actions**:
- Call external exchange rate API
- Update exchange rates in the system
- Notify finance team if rates change significantly (>5%)
- Log updates for audit trail

### 3. New Inquiry Assignment
**Trigger**: Webhook (new inquiry created)
**Purpose**: Automatically assign inquiries to engineers
**Actions**:
- Analyze inquiry details
- Check engineer availability and expertise
- Assign to most suitable engineer
- Send notification to assigned engineer
- Update inquiry status

### 4. Quote Approval Workflow
**Trigger**: Webhook (quote submitted for approval)
**Purpose**: Route quotes through approval process
**Actions**:
- Check quote value against approval thresholds
- Route to appropriate approver based on amount
- Send notification emails
- Set reminder if no action taken within 24 hours
- Update quote status upon approval/rejection

### 5. Shipment Tracking Updates
**Trigger**: Schedule (every 4 hours)
**Purpose**: Update shipment tracking information
**Actions**:
- Query carrier APIs for tracking updates
- Update shipment status in system
- Send notifications for key events (departure, arrival, customs clearance)
- Alert on delays or issues

### 6. Customer Credit Check
**Trigger**: Webhook (new order created)
**Purpose**: Verify customer credit before processing orders
**Actions**:
- Check customer credit limit
- Verify payment history
- Flag orders that exceed credit limits
- Notify sales team of credit issues
- Put order on hold if necessary

### 7. Inventory Reorder Alert
**Trigger**: Real-time (inventory level change)
**Purpose**: Alert when inventory falls below reorder point
**Actions**:
- Monitor inventory levels
- Compare with reorder points
- Generate purchase requisitions
- Send alerts to procurement team
- Create suggested purchase orders

### 8. Report Generation and Distribution
**Trigger**: Schedule (various times based on report type)
**Purpose**: Automatically generate and distribute reports
**Actions**:
- Execute scheduled reports
- Generate PDFs/Excel files
- Email to distribution list
- Save to document management system
- Update report execution log

### 9. Compliance Document Expiry
**Trigger**: Daily schedule
**Purpose**: Monitor compliance document expiration
**Actions**:
- Check document expiry dates
- Send reminders at 30, 15, and 7 days before expiry
- Escalate to management for critical documents
- Update compliance status
- Generate compliance reports

### 10. Customer Follow-up
**Trigger**: Schedule (based on customer interaction rules)
**Purpose**: Automated customer follow-up
**Actions**:
- Check last interaction date
- Send follow-up emails for quotes
- Schedule sales calls
- Update CRM with follow-up activities
- Generate customer engagement reports

## Workflow Configuration

### Setting Up Workflows

1. Access N8N dashboard through the integration settings
2. Select workflow template from available options
3. Configure trigger conditions
4. Map data fields between FastenMind and N8N
5. Set up notification recipients
6. Test workflow execution
7. Activate workflow

### Monitoring Workflows

- View execution history in the N8N integration page
- Check success/failure rates
- Review execution logs
- Set up alerts for workflow failures
- Monitor performance metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test workflows in a staging environment first
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
3. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when designing workflows
4. **Data Security**: Ensure sensitive data is properly encrypted
5. **Documentation**: Document custom workflows and their business logic
6. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for workflow failures
7. **Version Control**: Keep track of workflow versions and changes

## API Integration

The system provides the following APIs for N8N integration:

- `POST /api/n8n/webhooks/{webhook_id}` - Webhook endpoint for N8N triggers
- `GET /api/n8n/data/{entity_type}` - Fetch data for workflows
- `POST /api/n8n/update/{entity_type}` - Update data from workflows
- `POST /api/n8n/events` - Log workflow events

## Security Considerations

- All webhook endpoints require authentication
- API keys are stored securely and rotated regularly
- Workflow execution is logged for audit purposes
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- IP whitelisting available for N8N server

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Workflow not triggering**: Check webhook URL and authentication
2. **Data mapping errors**: Verify field mappings in workflow configuration
3. **Performance issues**: Check workflow complexity and optimize queries
4. **Authentication failures**: Verify API keys and permissions
5. **Rate limit errors**: Implement proper throttling in workflows
